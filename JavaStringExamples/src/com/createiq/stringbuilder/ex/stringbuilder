What is the use of String builder?
The StringBuilder class is useful for storing mutable elements. 
This saves memory because no extra memory is used after updating the StringBuilder sequence.

Why do we use String builder in Java?
One of the main reasons is StringBuilder is not thread-safe which means 
When multiple threads can access a StringBuilder object, it increases performance
 because no thread has to wait for their turn for a particular operation.

Is String builder efficient?:
Yes, StringBuilder is efficient because due to the mutable and non-thread-safe property of the StringBuilder.

Which is better: StringBuilder or String?:
StringBuilder is better because it is 6000 times faster than the String class.

Conclusion
String builders are mutable alternatives to regular strings in Java.
They provide better performance, especially when performing repeated concatenations.
They are not thread-safe and take up more memory than immutable strings.
